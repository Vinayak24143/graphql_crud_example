# GraphQl CRUD APIs with DJANGO and Graphene
In this project, I have developed CRUD APIs for two database tabled "book" and "writer".

To run the APIs clone the project,

Go to project folder

Then run these commands
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py migrate
python3 manage.py runserver
```

Your project is now running on http://localhost:8000/

You can go to http://localhost:8000/graphql to play around with APIs.
